# first_page Flutter App

A simple Flutter application displaying four numbered boxes in a 2x2 grid.

## Overview

This Flutter app is a basic layout example showcasing the use of `Row`, `Column`, `Expanded`, and `Container` widgets to create a grid-like structure. Each box is styled with a white background, rounded corners, a grey border, and displays a large, bold number. The app also features a dark-themed `AppBar` with rounded bottom corners.

## Features

* Displays a 2x2 grid of white boxes.
* Each box contains a centered, bold, black number (1, 2, 3, and 4).
* Boxes have rounded corners and a grey border.
* The background of the `Scaffold` is light grey.
* The `AppBar` is black with rounded bottom-left and bottom-right corners.

## Code Structure

The main widget of this application is `first_page`, a `StatelessWidget`.

* **`Scaffold`:** Provides the basic visual structure for the app, including the `AppBar` and `body`.
* **`AppBar`:** The top bar of the app, styled with a black background and rounded bottom corners using `RoundedRectangleBorder`.
* **`body`:** Contains the main content of the app, which is centered using `Center`.
* **`Column`:** Arranges the two `Row` widgets vertically.
* **`Row`:** Arranges the two `Expanded` `Container` widgets horizontally within each row.
* **`Expanded`:** Makes the `Container` widgets take up equal available space within their respective `Row`.
* **`Container`:** Used to create the styled boxes with a fixed height, margins, background color, rounded corners (`BorderRadius`), and a border (`Border.all`).
* **`Center`:** Centers the `Text` widget within each `Container`.
* **`Text`:** Displays the numbers with black color and a bold font weight.
* **`TextStyle`:** Used to style the text.
* **`BoxDecoration`:** Used to style the `Container` with color, border, and rounded corners.
* **`EdgeInsets.all(12.0)`:** Adds equal margin around each `Container`.

## Potential Enhancements

* Make the boxes interactive (e.g., respond to taps).
* Dynamically generate the number of boxes or their content.
* Implement different layout patterns.
* Add more sophisticated styling and animations.
